# Python-Challenge

In this Python assignment for Data Analytics Bootcamp I was asked to write two scripts: PyBank and PyPoll

1. PyBank
In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company.
I was provided with a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

I had to create Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

As an example, the analysis should look similar to the one below:
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

2. PyPoll

In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.
 
The requirement was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.


As an example,the analysis should look similar to the one below:
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
-------------------------
Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
Correy: 20.000% (704200)
Li: 14.000% (492940)
O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
-------------------------
Winner: Khan
